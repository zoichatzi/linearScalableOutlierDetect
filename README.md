## 0. Introduction

The goal of the present work is to discover abnormalities in two-dimensional data using linear complexity clustering techniques as a foundation. The solution performs effectively and effi-ciently in datasets with well-formed cycloid clusters. The solution has been implemented in Apache Spark using Scala.

*The present work is a project that was created in the context of “Technologies for Big Data Analytics” class.*
